   .. py:method:: RenderSettings()

      RenderSettings constructor


   .. py:method:: RenderSettings()

      RenderSettings constructor


   .. py:attribute:: AmbientLight

      System.Drawing.Color: Gets or sets the ambient light color used in rendering.

   .. py:attribute:: BackgroundColorTop

      System.Drawing.Color: Gets or sets the background top color used in rendering.
      Sets also the background color if a solid background color is set.

   .. py:attribute:: BackgroundColorBottom

      System.Drawing.Color: Gets or sets the background bottom color used in rendering.

   .. py:attribute:: UseHiddenLights

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to render using lights that are on layers that are off.

   .. py:attribute:: DepthCue

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to render using depth cues.
      These are clues to help the perception of position and orientation of objects in the image.

   .. py:attribute:: FlatShade

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to render using flat shading.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderBackFaces

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to render back faces.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderPoints

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to instruct the rendering engine to show points.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderCurves

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to instruct the rendering engine to show curves.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderIsoParams

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to instruct the rendering engine to show isocurves.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderMeshEdges

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to instruct the rendering engine to show mesh edges.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderAnnotations

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to instruct the rendering engine to show annotations,
      such as linear dimensions or angular dimensions.

   .. py:attribute:: UseViewportSize

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to use the resolution of the
      viewport being rendered or ImageSize when rendering

   .. py:attribute:: ScaleBackgroundToFit

      bool: Gets or sets a value indicating whether to scale the wallpaper in the
      background or not. This is meaningful only if the viewport has a wallpaper
      and render settings are set to render Wallpaper into the background.

   .. py:attribute:: TransparentBackground

      bool: Gets or sets whether rendering should be done with transparent background.

   .. py:attribute:: ImageDpi

   .. py:attribute:: NamedView

      str: Get or set the given named view

   .. py:attribute:: SnapShot

      str: Set or get the given snapshot view

   .. py:attribute:: SpecificViewport

      str: Set or get the given specific viewport

   .. py:attribute:: GroundPlane

      GroundPlane: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document ground plane.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's ground plane.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' ground plane object.

   .. py:attribute:: SafeFrame

      SafeFrame: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document safe-frame.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's safe-frame.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' safe-frame object.

   .. py:attribute:: Dithering

      Dithering: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document dithering.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's dithering.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' dithering object.

   .. py:attribute:: Skylight

      Skylight: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document skylight.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's skylight.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' skylight object.

   .. py:attribute:: LinearWorkflow

      LinearWorkflow: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document linear workflow.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's linear workflow.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' linear workflow object.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderChannels

      RenderChannels: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document render channels.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' render channels object.

   .. py:attribute:: Sun

      Sun: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document sun.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's sun.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' sun object.

   .. py:attribute:: RenderEnvironments


   .. py:attribute:: PostEffects

      PostEffectCollection: If this object is associated with a document, this gets the document post effect data collection.
      If this object is associated with a File3dm, this gets the File3dm's post effect data collection.
      Otherwise it gets a 'free-floating' post effect data collection object.
