## Contributing to rhino3dm

#### Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

* We track issues and feature requests with rhino3dm on github issues. Feel free to add issues for any bug you may find or feature you would like to see added.

#### Fixing bugs and adding Features

* Fork the `dev` branch of this repository.
  
* Open a new GitHub pull request with your changes.

* Please try to keep your pull request focused on a specific feature or bug. A single PR with a bunch of changes is much harder to review than many smaller and focused PRs.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant YouTrack issue number if applicable.

* Try to follow the coding conventions even they aren't your personal "style". Having all of the code look the same in general makes it easier to read.

#### Do you have questions about the source code?

* The best place to discuss the project is through our [discourse site](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/serengeti/rhino3dm) under the rhino3dm category
